CP4 Small Problems -- Solution Notes
====================================

Excel and CSV File Formats
--------------------------
Spreadsheet files are provided in both Excel and CSV formats.
The Excel files contain headers so the content is more easily human readable.
The CSV files do not contain headers so the content is reliably machine readable.
The evaluation computations are performed using the CSV files.
   
Important: The input files you create should be CSV files without headers.

GNU Octave
----------
The Matlab programs used for evaluation are compatible with GNU Octave.

Sample Sizes
------------
For the solutions that require generation of samples, it has been our experience that roughly 5,000 to 10,000 samples are sufficient for computing the metric.
